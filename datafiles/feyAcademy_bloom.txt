Welcome to Alfea, you should try meeting all the other students this year. 
I’m sure they all have interesting things to say to you.
Fairies train and hone their abilities by exploring the different stratums around Alfea. 
Flower Fields, the first stratum, contains the easiest monsters to defeat. 
At the end of each battle is a stratum boss. 
Beware you can not run away from them and they are stronger then average enemies.
I suggest you explore Willow Woods. 
Keep in mind it will be easier to get lost, all the stratums you encounter next will be larger in size. 
And if you haven’t already you should utilize the secret doors. They allow you to access previous areas more easily.
Autumn Falls contains many tricky holes. 
Watch your step, falling down one will lead you to the next floor.
The icey floors in Snowflake Point will not allow you to change direction once you start sliding. Be careful!
The clouds in Sakura Steps will disappear once you walk off them. 
Keep that in mind, I would not want you becoming trapped. 
At least they reappear once you exit and reenter.
The Fey temple contains many one way doors. 
Along with this, deep in the ruins the magic is extremely strong. So much so, that it will warp you somewhere new.
Watch your step as you explore the crumbling floors of the Ancient Abyss. 
Deep in the temple lives the Hydra. 
However, to even access the path to her you must defeat the four knights of darkness.
Traversing a rainbow is no easy stake. 
Then again, not everyone should be able to easily reach the heavens.
The four elemental goddesses live in the rainbows. 
You must defeat them if you wish to battle the guardian of heaven’s gates: the Fey Queen.
You were all wonderful students this year and I could not be prouder of what you have accomplished! 
Maybe my friends and I should try exploring these stratums one time.
