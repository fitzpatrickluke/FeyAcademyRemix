Why hello, I am Professor Luna. I teach astrology. 
Astrology will allow you to read the stars and figure your opponent out before they figure themselves out. 
Simple to explain, complex in practice.

Students always come to me asking what transformation I suggest for them. 
I just tell them to look at the grade requirements and pick out whichever one they think would suit them best based off of that.
As per usual there are already students beginning to fail this early in the year due to the challenge of this class.
I hate it when we mix up fairies and witches. They are similar and also different. 
In the end we are all just magical girls. 
Can’t everyone give this rivalry a rest. I’m tired of it.
I appreciate Nyx's commitment to learning this course. 
She is my best student, well technically Lapis is but I’m not sure if she is truly understanding the true purpose of this all. 
Oh look at me, I suppose I should stop with this gossip. 
That Arianna girl. I remember teaching her sister. Those two could not be more different. 
Yet it is refreshing to see a student so avid about learning but not letting that define her personality.
It’s this time of year once again. The time where fairies go off to defeat a dreadfully powerful guardian. 
I hope the topics I instilled within them will help against their final battles.

The year is over but don’t get too over yourself about that. 
The year is just begging for all of you. 
Take pride in your time here and use what you learned to become the best you can be. 
Promise me that.
