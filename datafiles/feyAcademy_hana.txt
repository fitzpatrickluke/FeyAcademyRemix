Sup, I’m Hana. I am a fairy of water. 
Yeah I know, basic, but just watch me, I will bring the party life to Alfea.

So I thought we all would do cool dances and poses when we transformed but apparently not. 
I will start a petition to require that in transformation. And maybe even start to require it through a class. 
Hey you, sign my petition when I make it, okay!
I literally just met Enya and like we are going to be best friends for freaking ever. 
Not only does she have an epically adorable fashion sense but like her power is so freaking strong. 
And she has a great personality too, can't forget that in a person.
Ack, don’t look at my face! The cold makes my skin all dry and I look hideous!
No wonder your water powers aren’t working properly. 
You're so strict on yourself and how you do things. You have no flow or variability in your life. 
And that is all what water is about. Especially being a fairy, not grades.
OMG, No Enya, you need to wait for me to get the leaves damp before you strike it with your flames. Adding too much fire will kill it.
We unlocked final transformations. I’ve been working on my dance, want to see. 
Wait no you should see it in the glorious blue flames of darkness. 
I look one hundred times more powerful and wonderful and full fairy guardian-like!

Perhaps Alfea wasn’t as hip, cool, y2k, magical girl as I expected. 
BUT… it was still totes amaze. Due to my best friend Enya. 
And you of course, girl you did your transformations even better than me.
