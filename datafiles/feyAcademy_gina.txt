Hello, my name is Gina. This is my best friend Nyx. 
I am a fairy of snakes. She is a fairy of mirrors. Nice to meet you. 
Aren’t you excited to learn from the amazing staff. I am.

Of course this view is wonderful. And of course those mountains are majestic. 
They are one of the largest mountain ranges in all of the magic dimension. 
Which is precisely why this school is located near them. 
While I java socialized with Paige and Tasha on a few occasions I can not see why they are criticizing Bridgit. 
With her fairy power she could eviscerate those two when ever wanted. 
They better watch out. I certainly will, for all three of them.
I dare say sometimes my power gets a bit out of control and I petrify others. 
I came to Clover to see if there is any herb to fix that. Not my proudest moment I admit. 
And I am training to focus my power more, but I still want to be cautious.
Nyx dragged me here. I personally don’t find astrology the most interesting. 
I think it is even a bit stupid. 
But she’s my friend and so dreadfully shy I needed to come with Nyx if she was ever to get here in the first place.
I suppose this stratum is nice. I’ve never been one for old things though, especially old magic. 
I like to look towards the future of magic. For example Tecna’s work with technomagic. 
She is very smart and skilled and the advancement and betterment of our magical society. 
I want to be like her some day.
It’s been fun exploring this extra large stratum. 
Finally a place that has actuall challenge.

This year is over. It was a magnificent year to say the least. 
And I guess you were cool too.
