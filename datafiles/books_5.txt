Transformations
Every party member has a transformation. Each transformation has a unique set of spells. Transformations affect the stats increased upon level up. Furthermore, each transformation has a unique special attack they may used during battle. To unlock a transformation one must spend enough skill points into the required course. Only one transformation can be used at a time. 
Skill Points
Each transformation requires a certain course grade to unlock. One may increase these grades by spending skill points. A student may speak to headmistress Bloom to reset all their skill points. The minimum required points for each grade are as follows:
E: Default Grade (0 points)
D: 10 points
C: 15 points
B: 20 points
A: 25 points
S: 30 points
The remaining books contain information on each transformation.
