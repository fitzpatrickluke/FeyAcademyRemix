Uh, bye.
Hello.

Uh, bye.
Ooh, the view from this bridge is so pretty Gina. 
The mountains are so majestic from this view. I wonder what creatures live in them? 
I hope those two don’t come over here. They seem mean.
It’s so interesting to read about the history of the magic dimension. Especially about the fey fairies. 
Supposedly we get to explore their stronghold soon. Isn’t that exciting!
Astrology class is one of my favorite topics. I asked Professor Luna if I could help her with anything. 
I’m so excited to be exploring the Fey Temple. 
I read it has the entrance to two magnificent stratums at the end.
Both Gina and I have been really enjoying this final stratum. 
It’s like a fun puzzle filled with monsters of myth. 
It’s also exciting to see our codex get almost filled up too!

Thanks for talking to me throughout the year. I really appreciated it. 
I hope we get to stay in touch.
