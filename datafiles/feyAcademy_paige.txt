Yes I am Paige, princess of Solaria. 
Please don't talk to me.
Please don't talk to me.
I hate getting so muddy in the forest, but what must be done must be done if we are to complete our mission.
Bridgit is over reacting. Honestly, all I said was that she should wear something different. 
And now I’m the bad guy.
Look at Vivian, so sad a princess can't keep her grades up. 
I have had top tier tutors since I was a child. 
My family expects nothing but the best from me and I will deliver.
Tigris refuses to make me a dress from these petals I gathered. 
I thought she liked designing clothes.
How rude.
I have seen tapestries of the fey temple but didn't know it actually existed. 
I'm just in a bit of shock that's all... 
Ugh! How did I not know this!
The abyss is dark. The abyss is cold. The abyss is suffocating. 
And of course I need to traverse it to reach the final destination of becoming a guardian fairy. 
It’s quite thrilling.
This rainbow stratum is the pure essence of light and hope and whatnot and it will greatly strengthen my powers. 
And yes, while I agree with Vivian on the fact that rainbows can be hard to accessorize I look good in anything, anywhere. 
So it’s not a problem I have so I can’t relate.
The year is over. I did it. I became a guardian fairy. 
Is it odd to not feel completely satisfied. 
I thought I would feel, I don’t know, just a bit more different. 
By the way, I’m sorry for being so rude to you. 
You’re actually a great person and fairy and I aspire to be at your level someday.
